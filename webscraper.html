							<h3>Idea & Introduction</h3>
							
							<p>
								This project was done in my spare time, as I was interested in coding a web scraper for some time. I've looked 
								at some websites but ended up choosing eBay as my scraping target.
								The idea was simple. Build a program to grab product information from eBay and put it in an Excel file.<br>
								There are multiple ways to do this, but I decided on using Python and a popular package named 'Beautiful Soup'. 
								This package makes it far easier to parse the HTML and XML documents and extract the data.
							</p>

							<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Developed using Python</li>
								<li>Package called 'Beautiful Soup' facilitates pulling the data out of XML and HTML files</li>
								<li>Data is stored into an Excel file</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Notable Features</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>The code takes no input from the user to run</li>
								<li>Web scraper is tailored to scrape data from a specific URL</li>
								<li>You can change the amount of web pages from which you want to scrape data from</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Conclusion</h3>

							<p>
								Small project but definetly helped with learning more about HTML and XML structures, as well as retrieving 
								data from the web. It had been a while since I've worked with Python so this project idea was definetly a 
								good way to re-introduce the language. I plan on doing a better frontend for the project, as I haven't done 
								UI in Python yet.
							</p>

							<h3>Files</h3>

							<p>
								The code is available on a <a href="https://github.com/eusebiuxii/ebay-webscraper">GitHub</a> repository. There is no documentation to go with it, as the project is not the same size as some of the others. It does, however, have comments throughout the code and should indicate what each part of the code is for.
