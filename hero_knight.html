							<h3> Introduction </h3>
							
							<p>
								This was the first "big" project I developed, and it was the final-year project for my A-Levels in Year 13. The project had to be of a bigger scale 
								than previous projects, but we were allowed to use different IDE's to help us achieve an end goal. 
							</p>
							
							<h3> Idea </h3>
							<p>
								After some consideration, and brainstorming a few ideas, I have decided on a 2D, pixel art, hack and slash game called 'Hero Knight'. 
								Inspired by the likes of 'Dead Cells' and 'Celeste', marking my first adventure in the world of game development. Aside from using Unity to actually 
								make the game, I planned to use a platform called Piskel for the assets (objects/characters) and animations, as well as using Firebase for an online 
								Login system, and a scoreboard.
							
							</p>
							
							<h3>
								Documentation & Coding
							</h3>

							<p>
								This was the most important part of the whole project. What mattered was not the end product of our code, but the documentation of it.
								Therefore, midway through the project, in order to maximise my grade, I had to focus more on the documentation rather than creating original
								assets/animations for the game. I resorted to using free assets from the Unity Asset Store. They did fit my game style in the end.<br>

								The coding part was also extremly new to me. Coding in C#, and using an IDE as extensive as Unity was hard at first. It took a lot of trial and error
								but after a while, I found myself quite comfortable in that space.<br>
								I tried to implement Firebase and ultimately failed. Between having too many errors that seemed untrackable, to being 
								pressured by a deadline, I was unable to implement it fully.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Conclusion
							</h3>

							<p>
								This project was extremly ambitious and new to me, but it was an experience I learned a lot from. I find it much harder to be
								overwhelmed and overloaded with information when tackling projects of similar size. <br>
								Better coding skills, less guessing when navigating an IDE, asset design and animation, documentation and testing the project, are	
								all things I've improved at because of this project.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Notable features
							</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Fully working menu with multiple screens</li>
								<li>Settings menu with sliders and button that afect the user's experience in real time</li>
								<li>Animated characters</li>
								<li>Responsive controls of character movements and attacks</li>
								<li>Enemy tracks the player and has a responsive health bar</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>
								Files
							</h3>

							<p>
								Here is the <a href="Hero Knight Project Documentation - E Moldovan.pdf">project documentation</a> if you wish to see the sort of work I did on this project. This includes coding, diagrams, design, testing etc.
								I cannot give the actual build/finished product as an .exe file, but you are free to look at the documentation.<br>
