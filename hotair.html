							<h1>Hot Air!</h1>

							<h3>Idea & Introduction</h3>
							
							<p>
								An education game with the goal to teach the player more about mathematics but can be changed 
								to other subjects with ease. The player is asked a question to which they can answer by 
								clicking one of the 4buttons at the bottom of the screen. Answering correctly builds up a 
								streak and increases their score whereas answering incorrectly resets the streak and decreases 
								the time left to answer questions. <br>
								The development of this project was done by a team of 6 people, where I focused mostly on the 
								actual coding of the project.
							</p>

							<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Coded in Unity using C#</li>
								<li>Used an Online Backend System to handle the LogIn and Leadeboard functionality</li>
								<li>Used built in features to create the menus, adding code where necessary</li>
								<li>Got art, audio, and sprites from Kenny Assets and other sites</li>
								<li>The rest of the art was made by our team</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>
								Notable features
							</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Using PlayFab Backend allowing for a safe LogIn/SignUp System</li>
								<li>An online leaderboard that updates with each players highest score</li>
								<li>Full menu system, including a log in, main menu, options menu, leaderboard, game, etc.</li>
								<li>Randomly generated maths questions</li>
								<li>Sound effects throughout the game</li>
								<li>Full options menu allowing players to change their game preferences</li>
								<li>Help Menus throughout the game to help players navigate the menus</li>
								<li>Web browser based deployment of the game at <a href="https://eusebiuxii.itch.io/hot-air" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a></li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Conclusion</h3>

							<p>
								I personally have become very familiar with Unity after my previous projects so this project was more complicated but also ended up being very refined. As I handled 
								most of the development on it, I tried to make sure that the code behind it can be swapped with easy to incorporate a different subject/language or whatever other changes 
								and ideas someone might have.<br>
								Gamifying learning is a big thing many developers and companies have got involved with and my teams attempt at it required us to be creative with an idea that has 
								been done many times before.
							</p>

							<h3>Files</h3>

							<p>
								The game files are available on <a href="https://github.com/eusebiuxii/hot-air" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, and the game can be 
								played for free on <a href="https://eusebiuxii.itch.io/icarus-initiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a><br>
								There is also a windows build, but it was made redundant by the browser version.
