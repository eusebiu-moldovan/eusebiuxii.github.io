							<h1>Year 1</h1>
							
							<h3>
								Comp 105 - Programming Language Paradigms
							</h3>

							<p>
								This module was mostly learning a new programming style, as well as a new programming language. The name of the language is 'Haskell' and its paradigm is purely functional programming. Looks and feels completly different compared to imperative programming languages.<br>
								It did help me become a better programmer, as well as widen my view of the different kinds of programming languages out there, but it is not a paradigm I continued using after the module finished.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Comp 108 - Data Sctructures and Algorithms
							</h3>

							<p>
								The name of the module is fairly self-explanatory. It explored arrays, queues, stacks, linked lists as well as different sorting algorithms and their efficiency. The module was mostly theory driven but these are very useful notions in computer science, some of which I applied in other modules in my course.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Comp 116 - Analytic Techniques for Computer Science
							</h3>
							
							<p>
								Many of the methods in this module are used in fields such as Machine Learning, Data Science, Algorithm Analysis, Experimental Computing and Optimisation. A very theory heavy module with complicated new concepts, some of which took time to fully grasp. It did widen my understanding of the related fields such as Data Science, but I haven't put this knowledge into practice yet.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Comp 122 - Object Oriented Programming
							</h3>
							
							<p>
								This was one of my favorite modules, as it had a lot of Java coding in it, but also explored explored concepts which I found very useful. Hierarchy of Related Classes, Polymorphism and GUI, concepts that were also put in practice in this module. The knowledge and skill gained from COMP 122 was very helpful for other future modules.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Comp 124 - Computer Systems
							</h3>

							<p>
								An introduction to the hardware and software components of a modern computer system. Learning about: the Linux Kernel, processes down to the CPU Register level, and coding in Assembly Language. The knowledge and skill gained from this module has yet to apply outside of it (other than Linux kernel), but regardless, it helped me understand more about the low-level innerworkings of modern systems.
