							<p>Here are some of the modules I have done during my studies. I selected based on how much I enjoyed them, and their perceived usefulness. 
								Each semester consists of 4 modules (8 in a year), but I only selected a few for each year to talk about.</p>

							<!--	 Year 1  	-->
							<h1>Year 1</h1>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 105 - Programming Language Paradigms</b><br>
										•&emsp;Focus on functional programming using Haskell<br>
										•&emsp;Had to relearn basics such as recursion because of the functional nature of the language<br>
										•&emsp;Helped widen my view of the different kinds of programming languages, but it was not a paradigm I used after the module has finished<br>
									</p>
									<p><b>Comp 108 - Data Sctructures and Algorithms</b><br>
										•&emsp;It explored arrays, queues, stacks, linked lists and different sorting algorithms comparing their efficiency<br>
										•&emsp;The module was mostly theory driven but these are very useful notions in computer science<br>
										•&emsp;The skills and knowledge learned have applied to a lot of problems I came across during my studies<br>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 116 - Analytic Techniques for Computer Science</b><br>
										•&emsp;A theory heavy module with complicated new concepts, some of which took time to fully grasp<br>
										•&emsp;Some of those concepts are complex numbers and their application, spectral methods, calculus, linear algebra, etc.<br>
										•&emsp;They proved their usefulness in later projects and modules<br>
									</p>
									<p><b>Comp 122 - Object Oriented Programming</b><br>
										•&emsp;This was one of my favorite modules, as it had a lot of Java coding in it, but also explored concepts which I found to be useful<br>
										•&emsp;Hierarchy of Related Classes, Polymorphism and GUI, all of which were also put in practice in this module<br>
										•&emsp;The knowledge and skill gained from COMP 122 led me to other interesting projects and making future modules easier to understand<br>
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>

							<!--	 Year 2  	-->
							<h1>Year 2</h1>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 202 - Complexity of Algorithms</b><br>
										•&emsp;Theory heavy module with a focus on asymptotic notation, AVL tree structures and different sorting algorithms<br>
										•&emsp;The module also consisted of a coding assignment which put into practie the material taught<br>
										•&emsp;A lot of this knowledge helps with general coding problems, especially when taking part in hackathons like ICPC<br>
									</p>
									<p><b>Comp 208 - Group Software Project</b><br>
										•&emsp;It explored arrays, queues, stacks, linked lists and different sorting algorithms comparing their efficiency<br>
										•&emsp;The module was mostly theory driven but these are very useful notions in computer science<br>
										•&emsp;The skills and knowledge learned have applied to a lot of problems I came across during my studies<br>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 222 - Game Design</b><br>
										•&emsp;A theory heavy module with complicated new concepts, some of which took time to fully grasp<br>
										•&emsp;Some of those concepts are complex numbers and their application, spectral methods, calculus, linear algebra, etc.<br>
										•&emsp;They proved their usefulness in later projects and modules<br>
									</p>
									<p><b>Comp 228 - App Development</b><br>
										•&emsp;This was one of my favorite modules, as it had a lot of Java coding in it, but also explored concepts which I found to be useful<br>
										•&emsp;Hierarchy of Related Classes, Polymorphism and GUI, all of which were also put in practice in this module<br>
										•&emsp;The knowledge and skill gained from COMP 122 led me to other interesting projects and making future modules easier to understand<br>

							<!--	 Year 3  	-->
							<h1>Year 3</h1>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 305 - Biocomputation</b><br>
										•&emsp;Explores concepts of neurons, neural networks, perceptrons, learning and genetic algorithms<br>
										•&emsp;It goes into detail about these concepts, which were hard to grasp at first<br>
										•&emsp;The module is purely theory, and so no practical work was done in relation to those concepts, but they were helpful in other modules<br>
									</p>
									<p><b>Comp 329 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics</b><br>
										•&emsp;It explored arrays, queues, stacks, linked lists and different sorting algorithms comparing their efficiency<br>
										•&emsp;The module was mostly theory driven but these are very useful notions in computer science<br>
										•&emsp;The skills and knowledge learned have applied to a lot of problems I came across during my studies<br>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 338 - Computer Vision</b><br>
										•&emsp;A theory heavy module with complicated new concepts, some of which took time to fully grasp<br>
										•&emsp;Some of those concepts are complex numbers and their application, spectral methods, calculus, linear algebra, etc.<br>
										•&emsp;They proved their usefulness in later projects and modules<br>
									</p>
									<p><b>Comp 343 - Computer Foresnics</b><br>
										•&emsp;Writing lots of essays and understanding forensic processes and laws when it comes to collecting digital evidence.<br>
										•&emsp;Carried out similar procedures using tools like Kali Linux and Autopsy, whilst writing a report on findings.<br>
										•&emsp;Read new academic papers on different forensic processes and improve certain sections and aspects.<br>
									</p>

							<!--	 Final Year Project  	-->
							<h1>FInal Year Project</h1>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<p><b>Comp 202 - Complexity of Algorithms</b><br>
										•&emsp;For my dissertation, I wanted to explore mobile development a bit more, whilst also improving my understanding of the “gamifying learning” philosophy.<br>
										•&emsp;I looked at similar ideas implemented by apps such as Kahoot and Duolingo and implemented my own version, specifically for mobile.<br>
										•&emsp;The design of the app was extensive, taking inspiration from flat colour schemes used by Apple, using heavy/bright colours as accents.<br>
										•&emsp;The app was developed in Flutter and Dart, integrated heavily with firebase for its login / authentication features, as well as the database of user data.<br>
										•&emsp;The app also uses a quiz data api for questions and answers, with multiple categories and options the user can choose from.<br>
										•&emsp;Overall, the project idea was simple but implemented with technologies I haven’t used before, so a lot of issues arose because of that. But most of the features I planned for were implemented, but failing to implement any sort of co-op or multiplayer gameplay.
