							<h1>Fortuna</h1>

							<h3>Idea & Introduction</h3>
							
							<p>
								This project was part of a University module. It consisted of designing and making an iOS application in Xcode, therefore coded in Swift. The design of the UI and flow of the application had 
								to be taken into account, as well as thinking about the colour schemes used, fonts, etc.<br>
								The game picks a random phrase from a JSON file which stores different phrases and genres, similar to wheel of fortune. The game displays the phrase to the user but the letters are hidden. 
								The user can input a single letter of their choice or the whole phrase as a guess but they only have 10 lives available to guess the full phrase. They rack up points for each letter they guess, 
								or extra points for each letter they reveal by guessing the full phrase. Their score is then stored onto a sorted leaderboard.
							</p>

							<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Xcode IDE, coded using Swift and interface made using Storyboard</li>
								<li>Decoding the objects from JSON data files</li>
								<li>Scores are stored into a table</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Notable Features</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>A random phrase is picked from the JSON files</li>
								<li>Users can make a singer letter guess, or guess the whole phrase</li>
								<li>Players gain more points for guessing the full phrase earlier in the game</li>
								<li>The game finished when the player guessed the full phrase or lives run out</li>
								<li>Their high score is stored into a table, which is sorted in order from highest</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Conclusion</h3>

							<p>
								App development is a field I am very interested in. Doing projects like these for my University degree gives me more of a reason to spend hours on them.
								I try to make them into a good experience for someone that would try out my project. 'Fortuna' was a great way to start iOS development, however, 
								I want to try developing for other platforms such as Android in future projects.
							</p>

							<h3>Files</h3>

							<p>
								The files are available on <a href="https://github.com/eusebiuxii/Fortuna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, however, the project can only be edited and run using MacOS. The game is NOT available on the App Store. 
								There is also a <a href="Documents/Fortuna - Explained.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a> showing what each part of the UI does in case people do not find it intuitive.
