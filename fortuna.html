							<h3> Introduction </h3>
							
							<p>
								This project was part of a University module. It consisted of designing and making an iOS application in Xcode, therefore coded in Swift. The design of the UI and flow of the application had 
								to be taken into account, as well as thinking about the colour schemes used, fonts, etc.
							</p>
							
							<h3> 
								Idea
							</h3>

							<p>
								The game picks a random phrase from a JSON file which stores different phrases and genres, similar to wheel of fortune. The game displays the phrase to the user but the letters are hidden. 
								The user can input a single letter of their choice or the whole phrase as a guess but they only have 10 lives available to guess the full phrase. They rack up points for each letter they guess, 
								or extra points for each letter they reveal by guessing the full phrase. Their score is then stored onto a sorted leaderboard.
							
							</p>

							<h3>
								Coding & Design
							</h3>

							<p>
								The app was made using Xcode and the storyboard feature of it, allowing me to add UI elements and edit them making the app more appealing and easy to use. <br>
								I've kept a mostly a black theme throughout the app, along with splitting the phone screen in two halfs. The top half is data displayed to the user, as it is the harder part of the phone to reach with your thumbs. 
								The bottom half is where most buttons, fields, and pop-up keyboard will be, making it easy to use the app.<br>
								All of the phrases are stored in JSON files. The game picks a phrase randomly so adding more phrases can make the game more fun.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Files
							</h3>

							<p>
								The files are available on <a href="https://github.com/eusebiuxii/Fortuna">GitHub</a>, however, the project can only be edited and run using MacOS. The game is NOT available on the App Store.
